Tornado templates highlighter for Brackets

Important for Brackets < 1.1
================
Please, since i am a bad programmer, i need an update to make it work independently, so you have to do an extra step to make it work, this way, you will make think that Brackets is shipped with a special edition of CodeMirror:

 1. Download this [folder][1]
 2. Locate your {original installation}\Brackets\www\thirdparty\CodeMirror2\mode (windows, mac i dont know, sorry).
 3. Add the folder as a name *tornado* and copy the contents you downloaded from (1).
 4. Your extension should work now :)

I am sorry again for the workaround, i need some serious javascript courses :D

And for better colors, you can use this theme:

Edit
================
As 14/10/2014, [Tornado Templates is supported by CodeMirror][2], so, the next build of brackets will include this version, that means that you will be compatible with Brackets >= 0.45.

Brackets 1.1 supports the latest build of CodeMirror, now you can use the extension directly without doing any further steps :)
